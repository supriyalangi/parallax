        <p><b>ZERO WATER</b></p>
        <p>The average pair of sneakers needs 2,275 gallons of water during production. Thanks to 3D knitting, 3D
            printing and hand-molding, the amount we need is zero.</p>

        <p><b>ZERO WEAST</b></p>
        <P>We print and knit our shoes as they are ordered, with no scrap or offcuts in the process. No excess
            inventories or waste.</P>

        <p><b>TOTALLY RECYCLABLE</b></p>
        <p>Our sneakers are made to be broken down and reused. When you're done with your pair, email us at info@xyz.com
            with your order number. We'll send you a shipping lable to send them in for recycling and give you 20% off
            your next order.</p>

        <p><b>BREAK & REMAKE</b></p>
        <P>To create sneakers without leaving any waste behind, we actively source plastic bottles colllected from the
            ocean to turn into thread, putting about eight bottles worth of rPET into every pair of shoes.</P>

        <p><b>3D KNITTED</b></p>
        <P>Through intricate 3D knitting, we turn recycled plastic threads into comfortable, flexible sneakers without
            creating any weaste. It's a process that's both unorthodox and uncompromising.</P>

        <p><b>3D PRINTED</b></p>
        <p>By printing our midsoles, we use less energy than a typical sneaker manufacturer. Combined with our water and
            waste savings, we're building the future of sneaker production.</p>
